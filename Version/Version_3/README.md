# Version 3: Adding Torque Calculation with Two Load Cells

## Description
This version introduces two load cells to measure the torque generated by the motor/propeller combination. Torque is calculated as the difference between the left and right load cells.

## Features
- Basic PWM control for the motor.
- Thrust and torque measurement.
- Adjustable test duration.

## Pinout
- **ESC Signal**: Pin 11
- **Load Cell Left (DT)**: Pin 3
- **Load Cell Left (SCK)**: Pin 2
- **Load Cell Right (DT)**: Pin 4
- **Load Cell Right (SCK)**: Pin 5
- **Ground**: Connected to Arduino GND and ESC GND

## Hardware Required
- Arduino Uno
- ESC (Electronic Speed Controller)
- Brushless Motor
- Two Load Cells (for torque)
- HX711 Load Cell Amplifier
- Power Supply for ESC and Motor

## What It Prints
- PWM percentage.
- Thrust in kg and N.
- Torque in kg and N.
