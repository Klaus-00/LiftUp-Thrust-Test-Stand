# Version 1: Basic Motor Control

## Description
This version introduces basic motor control using Arduino and an ESC. The motor speed is controlled through PWM, increasing linearly over time.

## Features
- Basic PWM control for the motor.
- Configurable minimum and maximum PWM percentages.
- Adjustable test duration.

## Pinout
- **ESC Signal**: Pin 11
- **Ground**: Connected to Arduino GND and ESC GND

## Hardware Required
- Arduino Uno
- ESC (Electronic Speed Controller)
- Brushless Motor
- Power Supply for ESC and Motor

## What It Prints
- PWM percentage during the test.
