# Version 2: Adding a Single Load Cell for Thrust Measurement

## Description
This version introduces a single load cell to measure the thrust generated by the motor and propeller. The thrust is calculated in both kilograms (kg) and Newtons (N).

## Features
- Basic PWM control for the motor.
- Integration of a single load cell for thrust measurement.
- Adjustable test duration.

## Pinout
- **ESC Signal**: Pin 11
- **Load Cell Signal (DT)**: Pin 6
- **Load Cell Clock (SCK)**: Pin 7
- **Ground**: Connected to Arduino GND and ESC GND

## Hardware Required
- Arduino Uno
- ESC (Electronic Speed Controller)
- Brushless Motor
- Load Cell (for thrust)
- HX711 Load Cell Amplifier
- Power Supply for ESC and Motor

## What It Prints
- PWM percentage.
- Thrust in kg and N.
